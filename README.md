# Real-Time Video Chat Application(C.O.N.V.O)


This project is a real-time video chat application built using Agora's RTM (Real-Time Messaging) SDK and WebRTC. Users can create or join video chat rooms via a simple user interface.

Features
Create or Join Rooms: Users can join a video chat room by entering an invite code.
Real-Time Communication: Peer-to-peer video communication using WebRTC and STUN servers.
Camera & Microphone Control: Users can toggle their camera and microphone on or off during a call.
User Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface with a form to join rooms.


Project Structure
lobby.html: The entry point where users can join or create rooms by providing an invite link. It also handles redirection to the video chat room.
main.js: Manages the core functionality of the application, including setting up the video chat connection, handling new participants, sending/receiving video streams, and toggling the camera and microphone.


How It Works
Join/Create Room: The user submits a room code in the lobby page (lobby.html). If no code is provided, the app redirects back to the lobby.
Video Connection: Using WebRTC, the app captures audio and video, and establishes peer-to-peer connections through STUN servers.
Agora RTM: Agora is used to manage room membership and send signaling messages for WebRTC (offers, answers, and ICE candidates).


UI Elements:

#user-1: The local video stream.

#user-2: The remote participantâ€™s video stream.
Buttons to toggle camera and microphone during the call.
